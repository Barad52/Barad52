                        us. The atmosphere, climate, ecosystem, flora and fauna, and many more exist within this nature
                        to maintain a smooth balance. <br> <br> Nature is the biggest reason for our easy survival on
                        this planet. It provides us with food, clothing, and shelter. The sunlight, plants, air, rain,
                        animals, and everything combine to complete nature. It makes our environment liveable and
                        beautiful. It has given life to human beings, and it was present even before the evolution of
                        human beings. It makes a natural cycle for the smooth functioning of every living being. There
                        is a reason why nature is referred to as “mother”. Mother nature cherishes and nurtures us.

                        bachelorette, up on a rooftop pool drinking to pink. Whatever the reason for seeking a sunset,
